Wiring Components:
Wemos D1 Mini: The microcontroller handling MIDI and the buttons.
LED: Connected to provide visual feedback for the beat.
Button (for tempo programming): This button is used to set the tempo by detecting two presses.
Plus Button: This button increases the BPM by 1 each time it’s pressed.
Minus Button: This button decreases the BPM by 1 each time it’s pressed.
MIDI Output: Sending MIDI clock signals to connected MIDI devices.

Pin Configuration:
LED: Connected to D2.
Tempo Button: Connected to D1.
Plus Button: Connected to D5.
Minus Button: Connected to D6.
MIDI Output: Connected to D3.

Wiring Instructions:
1. LED (connected to D2):
Anode (+) of the LED is connected to D2 through a 220Ω resistor.
Cathode (-) of the LED is connected to GND (Ground).
2. Tempo Button (connected to D1):
One pin of the button is connected to D1.
The other pin of the button is connected to GND (Ground).
No external pull-up resistor is needed, as you're using the internal pull-up by configuring pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP) in the code.
3. Plus Button (connected to D5):
One pin of the button is connected to D5.
The other pin of the button is connected to GND (Ground).
Again, the internal pull-up resistor is activated using pinMode(PLUS_BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP) in the code.
4. Minus Button (connected to D6):
One pin of the button is connected to D6.
The other pin of the button is connected to GND (Ground).
The internal pull-up resistor is used with pinMode(MINUS_BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP) in the code.
5. MIDI Output (connected to D3):
Pin 5 of the MIDI DIN connector is connected to D3 via a 220Ω resistor.
Pin 4 of the MIDI DIN connector is connected to 5V via a 220Ω resistor.
Pin 2 of the MIDI DIN connector is connected to GND.
